			<h2><a href="http://imgur.com/a/z6Jyi">Portfolio</a></h2>
			<p>This is where I showcase my artwork that I have created in the past. The collection includes both templates and custom artwork that were created by me. The templates are reusable and sold at a cheaper price than custom artwork. Feel free to look through and gain inspiration. <br> (clicking 'portfolio' will direct you)</p>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<p> <b>How do I request artwork?</b> <br> After adding me, describe to me exactly what you want - that means positioning, effects, and overall goal of the animation. <br><br><b>How much do you charge?</b><br> I am currently charging 2 to 4 CS:GO keys / $4 to $9. The price is determined by the difficulty of the piece. The lowest price is for the templates I made that I reuse if the client desires. <br><br> <b>How will I receive my artwork?</b><br> After finishing the animation, I will send you a watermarked version and continue changing it to your liking. Once you are satisfied, I will accept the payment via steam or paypal then send you the unwatermarked version for download.</p>
